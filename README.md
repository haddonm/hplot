# hplot

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of hplot is to provide a simple way to include an array of
pre-defined base R graphics and helpers. They include many that I use
personally. I have distilled functions from rutilsMH, rforcpue, and
other of my packages. I will list the origins in the readme each time I
include a new function.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("haddonm/hplot")
```
